UI Color Psychology
Gentle, muted palettes grounded in nature typically foster calmness and emotional safety. Studies note that
blue and green hues lower stress and enhance balance ; for example, Calm’s palette uses deep sky-blue
(#1B2250) and soft blue (#6282E3). Soft pastel blues, teals and sage greens promote trust and serenity ,
while warm neutrals (cream, beige) add comfort. High contrast (dark text on light backgrounds) is vital for
readability and accessibility. Accent colors should be sparing (≤10% usage) and gentle (e.g. pastel peach or
lavender).
Primary: Soft aqua-blue (#A3D5D3) – invokes tranquility (blue-green studies show positive mood
effects).
Secondary: Muted sage green (#B5CDA3) – ties to health and balance.
Neutral/Background: Warm off-white or cream (#FAF8F0) – clean, inviting canvas.
Accent: Pale peach (#FFCBA4) or lavender (#C3AED6) – adds uplift in small doses (e.g. buttons,
highlights) .
Contrast: Dark gray text (#4A4A48) on light backgrounds to meet accessibility standards; avoid
harsh black or neon.
By using muted, natural tones (earthy blues/greens and soft neutrals) rather than bright or saturated
colors, the UI signals emotional safety and clarity. This aligns with trends showing wellness/meditation apps
favor greens/blues .
Spinner Icon (Ritual Wheel)
Use smooth, organic shapes and nature metaphors to convey symbolic spinning, not competition.
Suggestions:
Metaphoric Wheel: A mandala or lotus that slowly rotates; or a sun/moon phase circle that aligns
with time.
Nature Motifs: A spinning leaf, feather or flower petals sequence; a rippling water circle (like a
drop’s ripple) representing gentle flow.
Spiritual Motifs: A dreamcatcher/spiral pattern or Tibetan prayer wheel concept, but stylized
with minimal lines (as in Headspace’s friendly curves).
Animation Style: Very slow, easing rotation with subtle glow or pulse (e.g. a faint aura expanding
and contracting). Avoid sharp tick sounds or sudden jumps.
The spinner’s segments should have curved edges and even spacing (no sharp, threatening angles).
Colors on the wheel should remain within the calm palette (e.g. pastel segments); avoid red/green win/lose
colors. The goal is a meditative ritual, so even if there is a pointer, design it as a floating leaf or soft arrow
rather than a gaudy pointer.

Luck Index UI
The Luck Index should feel observational, not evaluative. Design ideas:
Soft Gauge: Show luck as a gentle semi-circle or arc meter with a pastel gradient fill (e.g. dawn-tonoon sky). The pointer could be a small sun/moon icon that moves subtly. Use neutral hues (soft
yellow/blue) rather than “good/bad” colors.
Organic Animation: Animate the icon with a slow breathing pulse or glow rather than a sharp
progress bar. For example, an icon that “breathes” (expanding/contracting circle) to indicate
fluctuation without a numeric gauge.
Natural Iconography: Use non-judgmental symbols (e.g. a clover leaf, star, or wave). It could
morph gently (e.g. a wave rising and falling), suggesting ebb and flow of luck.
Contextual Display: Accompany the index with a short text/phrase (“Gentle day ahead,” etc.) in soft
typography. Always emphasize balance: e.g. if luck is “low,” the UI might shift to cooler blues; if
“high,” warmer golds – but keep both subdued.
Animations should be slow and calming (like a plant growing or tides moving, not a filling progress bar).
Avoid success/failure cues (no green checkmarks or red warnings). For example, you might animate a lotus
blooming slightly more for higher luck, but never use “rankings” or points. The Luck Index feels like a
weather forecast for mood – informative but gentle.
App Icon
The icon should be simple, symbolic and inviting. Use a rounded or softly-curved shape (fits both iOS
rounded-square and Android adaptive guidelines). Effective motifs include: a stylized lotus blossom, zen
stone stack, rising sun/mountain, or dreamcatcher – elements that connote ritual and tranquility. For
example, a lotus symbolizes purity and calm (as shown above). Avoid sharp angles or overly complex
designs; Headspace’s use of simple friendly circles inspires an unthreatening feel.
Shape & Lines: Round shapes and smooth curves only; no jagged edges or aggressive arrows. The
icon mark itself can be circular or oval inside a rounded square.
Imagery: Natural or spiritual symbols (lotus, leaf, cloud, candle flame); consider dual imagery (e.g.
two interlocking shapes) to hint at balance. Icons like Calm’s use a simple graphic (a wave) in blue,
while Headspace uses an orange circle. We suggest a similarly minimal silhouette (perhaps a lotus
outline or abstract sun).
Color: Use one or two muted core colors from the app palette. For example, a pale teal icon on
cream, or a soft lavender on white background. If an accent is needed (for standout), use the chosen
pastel accent hue rather than bright orange. Keep overall look clean and airy.
Emotion: Convey calm and warmth. (Headspace’s vibrant orange shows energy, but our icon should
feel more subdued.) The design should invite ritual/meditation, not gamification.
By following platform guidelines (rounded-corner icon for iOS, adaptive layers for Android) and focusing on
a clear symbolic image, the icon will stand out in stores while reflecting the app’s core value of gentle
ritual.

Competitive ASO Visual Audit
Color & Imagery: Top wellness/spiritual apps consistently use soft palettes and simple icons. For example,
Calm and Insight Timer favor cool blues and greens , while Headspace breaks the mold with an orange
circle. (In general, ASO research shows wellness/meditation apps often choose blue/green to signal
tranquility .) Journaling/self-care apps often use cheerful illustrations or emotive characters (Daylio’s
smiling mood-face icon, for instance). Spiritual or tarot apps lean on dark or cosmic motifs (stars, eyes,
moons in purple/black) to evoke mystery.
Iconography & UI Traits: Common UX patterns include minimal text/icons, generous white space, and
nature-based graphics. For instance, Calm’s UI and icon use a simple wave form and blue hues;
Headspace’s design is bold and minimal (flat shapes, sans-serif text). Apps like Shine or Oak Meditation use
pastel gradients and gentle animations to feel nurturing. Most avoid gamification cues (no leaderboards
or badges in sight) and instead show progress via subtle animations or journaling stats. In ASO terms, store
screenshots emphasize serene imagery and testimonials, not points or high-scores.
Patterns that Boost Retention: Brands with cohesive, soothing visual identity tend to perform better in
this category. Our audit suggests that using consistent nature or spiritual iconography, a calm color
scheme, and a clutter-free layout (as Calm and Insight Timer do) supports strong engagement .
Conversely, overly bright or game-like visuals (red on green progress bars, flashing indicators) are rare in
top-ranking “wellness” apps, as they conflict with the desired emotional tone.
Platform Consistency
All recommendations conform to Apple’s and Android’s guidelines:
Apple (HIG) & Accessibility: Use SF Symbols and dynamic type for clarity. Ensure high contrast
(dark text/graphics on light backgrounds or vice versa). Support Dark Mode with adjusted pastel
tones (e.g. beige→dark blue backgrounds). Provide customizable themes (light/soothing mode vs.
normal) as advised. Follow the Human Interface Guidelines for touch targets, legible fonts, and calm
haptics/animations.
Android (Material Design): Adopt Material 3, using responsive components and Motion. Leverage
Material You’s dynamic color to allow the UI to adapt softly to user’s wallpaper while maintaining a
tranquil base palette. Google specifically notes a wellness app can use “calming, expressive hues to
soothe anxiety”. Ensure Material theming (shape, elevation) aligns with our soft aesthetic (e.g.
rounded cards, gentle shadows).
General Best Practices: Keep a uniform look across platforms (same icons, colors), while respecting
each platform’s style (iOS rounded tabs vs. Android bottom nav). Always prioritize legibility and
comfort: use the recommended font sizes and spacing. Test with VoiceOver/TalkBack to ensure the
color scheme and UI affordances remain intuitive.
By blending our calm, nature-inspired palette and iconography with both Apple’s HIG and Android’s
Material guidelines, the app will feel native and inclusive on each platform.
